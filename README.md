## ALGORITHMS
***
### Steps to developing a usable algorithm.

- Model the problem.
- Find an algorithm to solve it.
- Fast enough? Fits in memory?
- If not, figure out why.
- Find the way to address the problem.
- Iterate until satisfied.

1. **[Unionâ€“Find Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)** is a data structure that
stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint
subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a 
representative member of a set. The last operation makes it possible to find out efficiently if any two elements 
are in the same or different sets.
